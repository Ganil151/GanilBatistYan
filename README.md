### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
Optimizing **GitOps workflows** with ArgoCD and refining **Karpenter** autoscaling policies to further reduce cloud compute waste in high-traffic Kubernetes environments.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Mastering advanced cluster security for the **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)** and deep-diving into **AWS Solution Architecture (SAA-C03)** to design more resilient global infrastructures.

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
My [DevOps Repository](https://github.com/Ganil151/Devops.git)! 🚀 I’m building a collection of best-practice manifests and scripts. Feel free to **clone the repo**, submit a PR, or drop some innovative ideas in the issues!

### ❤️ I love Tech
I thrive at the intersection of development and operations. My passion lies in creating systems that are not just "up," but are **observable, self-healing, and cost-efficient.**

### 🚀 Transforming Code into Scalable Infrastructure
I am a **DevOps Engineer** with 4+ years of experience focused on building high-performance, secure, and cost-effective cloud environments. My mission is to bridge the gap between development and production through **automation**, **observability**, and **reliability**.
